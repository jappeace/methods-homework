##Why would it be useful to put an image into video memory before sending it to the screen?

This technique is called backbuffering. Its used to prevent flickering of the screen.
If you don't do it a part of the image is sometimes rendered while its already shown
causing part of the screen to be empty which causes a small flikering. I know
because I've written games that used to suffer this problem.
