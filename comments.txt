You probably can replace the chapters with sections, making the entire
thesis more cohesive since its not that big. 
(although more students seem to have chosen this appraoch so perhaps I 
just have bad taste)

headings in the intro are kind of annoying.
Finding the goal in te intro was difficult, its mentioned at the end of the 
inspiration setion wich is weird.

first headings called introduction per chapter can be removed 
(kindoff redundant)

Aren't sripts also used in theater?

4.1 definition third sentence starts with thirdly out of the blue.

OCC model isn't mentioned until the implementation chapter
Wait what, ALICE is used, how?!
In the implementation section in the structure overview you mention on the

The only extension would be the use of a * rather than a tag, its kindoff

(although to be fair you had a placeholder for this)
Why didn't you choose groovy jython, or clojure? (sticking in jvm based script domain)

You could add too "comminucate!" disadvantages
that its written in PHP, which is critisized, a lot https://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/
But I don't know if that's appropriate.
I don't know why you replaced the client (if you did this...).
