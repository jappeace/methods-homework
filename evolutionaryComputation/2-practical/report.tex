\title{Graph bipartitioning and you}
\maketitle

\section{Introduction}
This is a report of the evolutionary practical assignment 2.
In here I will discuss the execution of the assignment, what it was, which
methodology was used to execute the assignment.

The intended audience is people familiar with programming.

\section{Assignment}
Graphbipartitioning is dividing a graph into 2, with as little edges between
both graphs as possible.

\section{Methodology}
I coppied all the code from the previous practical into this new folder.
Then I went onto a delete rage. Most code was deleted except the Expirment
class, this will probably still be usefull.

I use git, so it doens't really matter to accidently delete to much. After
that I changed the data, I removed everything which was useless. Now the file
only contains the connection numbers. This makes parsing the file a lot
easier. I don't want to do advanced pattern matching when I can quickly modfy
the file with a few vim macros. (in this case I just did a `30x').

\section{TODO}
MLS with several results
