Reconsider openRA? Teacher explisitly told us to grab stuff from the internet.
I also think its just more fun. No need to finish for certain, in the first
class he told us it was allowed to fail.

Use OperA (I dread the similarity in names), to design roles and shit before hand.
Teacher seems in love with that.
(Could we modify this with Deontonic logic and use it as
a "research" paper??! I mean doing research for design
sounds stupid, but since "most", of us already know this we
can tottaly do that)

Teacher loves social stuff like body language?

If we're gonna do a scripting language:
	* Python?
	* Lua
	* Perl?? (black magick)
	* Ruby
I think we should avoid scripting, because in my opinion
this project is to complex to not have a type system.
We should use a strongly typed language. Candidates:
	* Rust
	* Haskell
Then there are the the other ones I don't recommend but technically could work:
	* Go (competes with Java (and loses), and loses from Rust on speed and inventiveness)
	* D (competes with Go)
	* Erlang (gets eaten by Scala)
Also candidates but criticised for reasons:
	* C# (Jappie don't likey)
	* JVM based (Jonas don't likey)
	* Scala.js?? (Strongly typed but compiles to javascript, but Jonas may not likey)
	* C++/C (unsafe, we should avoid this)

We could do use a neural network to do learning since the
input and output is predetermened? We could use neuroevolution?
