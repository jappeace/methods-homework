Reconsider openRA? Teacher explisitly told us to grab stuff from the internet.
I also think its just more fun. No need to finish for certain, in the first
class he told us it was allowed to fail.

Use OperA (I dread the similarity in names), to design roles and shit before hand.
Teacher seemse in love with that.
