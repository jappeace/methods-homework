1.
It minimizes the amount of sharp angles.
2.
If the line segments are obstacles than the voronoi divesion will show paths
for the robot to travel. If you assume the robot is in the shape of a
bounding disc. 
3.
Often you can solve degenerate cases by analysing geometry. Alernativly you can
use some consistent aggreement on handling them. For example in the plane
sweep you handle same y-coordinate by taking the elft most element first.

Another way of handeling them is just doing input verification and stating you
don't deal with certain kind of inputs.
