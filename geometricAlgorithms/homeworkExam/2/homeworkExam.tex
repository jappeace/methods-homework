\section{A disk and some half-planes}
\subsection{Per case, what can you say about $H$}
\begin{enumerate}[i]
	\item \emph{There is no disk that has its centor non the $x$ axis
			that lies inside all half-planes.}

		There exists some half plan whose's area never crosses the x axis
		(so is either completly above or below y=0).
	\item \emph{There are arbitrarly large disk with the specifications.}

		The half planes do not enclose the disk area.
	\item \emph{The largest disk exists and is unique.}


	\item \emph{There are several equally large largest disks}
