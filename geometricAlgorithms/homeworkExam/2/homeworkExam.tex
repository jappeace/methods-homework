\section{A disk and some half-planes}
\subsection{Per case, what can you say about $H$}
Let $H_i$ be the intersection of halfplanes of $H$.
\begin{enumerate}[i]
	\item \emph{There is no disk that has its centor non the $x$ axis
			that lies inside all half-planes.}

		$H_i$ never crosses the x axis,
		so it exists entirely above or below $y=0$.

	\item \emph{There are arbitrarly large disk with the specifications.}

		$H_i$ is open on one side with no line parralel to te x axis and
		each line can at most have $\pi$ radials angle difference
		compared to the line that is most paralel to the x axis.

	\item \emph{The largest disk exists and is unique.}

		$H_i$ produces an area with no x-axis parralel lines.

	\item \emph{There are several equally large largest disks}

		$H_i$ produces an area with x-axis parralel lines.
