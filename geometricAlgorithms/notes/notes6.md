#Queries??

Rectangular range quaries, only work with axis parralel??

#Storage
there exists storage that is bigger than linear?! (Probably some sort of index)

# trees
reporting the anwsers of a tree takes linear time becuase connection nodes
are fewer than the anwser.

Pruning man, ask alfa beta!! white nodes get pruned

## Faster 2d trees


### Storage
maximum O(n^2) because double, however effectivally you can do it O(N log N) 
because points only occur on there own search paths.

Ascosiated structure. nodes have left right children and a tree that is
sorted differently

You can't run faster than  the amount of storage you're using ?!
## Log magick!

log^2 n = (log n)^2
log n^2 = 2 * log n

# What is the lower bound for
## O(log n + k) querry time
O(nx log n/log log n)

## O(n/e) storage
O(sqrt(n)) O(n^e)

# Composite numbers


# TO proof
word uitgelegd in datastructuren?? miss ff spioneren?
