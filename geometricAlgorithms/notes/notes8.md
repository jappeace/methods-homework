# bounds
## Algorithm
Lower bound is easy: well for a specific input its just gonna take so much time.

Upper bound is hard: needs to do it for all inputs in so much time.

## Problem
Lower bound is hard: because you need to prove it for all inputs.

Upper bound is easy: just make an algorithm that shows it can be solved.
