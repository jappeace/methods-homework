What were your conclusions regarding relation types based on your own data?

Collocation and coordination are by far the most common responses. I think
this also holds true for the collective data but its difficult to say.

Last week we said that synonyms have a stronger relation than
coordinations - can this claim be made based on our data?

No, because my data indicates that coordinations happen more often
than synonyms. But it could be that the type of words that were
chosen have to do with this. For example its difficult to say a
synonym for red.

Some researchers ask not only for the first association, but the first 5 for each word. Do
you think this is a better method when our goal is to model the mental lexicon?

Yes, because there is quite a good chance that multiple words are triggered.
Asking to respond with multiple words gives a better indication of those which
are popular.
This way you could also rank second popular and third popular choices.
It also makes people think better about the responses.

Do you think free associations is a good method to model the mental lexicon? What are
the advantages and disadvantages of this method?

The advantage is that the test is rather quick and non invasive. You'll
have very fast results.
The disadvantage is that you
require lots of subject and words to give a proper overview, creating a
lexicon of an entire language would be a daunting task.

How can we improve this task to make it more productive/educational/fun/interesting for
next year?

I thought the individual excel files would be publicized on black board rather
than a merged file. Just putting the individual files online is a lot less
word and has the advantage that the categories are already there. You could
even do so shell magic to combine them rather easily.
