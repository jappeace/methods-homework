Also no experiments are present, though announced shortly.

Tidiness
--------
Based on this I can only conclude that the tidiness of the paper is not up
to the standard you might expect in the final paper.
Though this can be addressed easily by looking critically at what is
written and how it was written.


VREESWIJK:

Globally: the paper seems to be heading in the right direction.
Satisficing play is discussed and just enough mathematical
detail is given. The small tables look nice and are convenient
references. However, right now I find the approach somewhat
conservative.  The paper's ambition seems to be to explain
satisficing play.  Of course a lucid explanation is important,
but you can be critical.
A more exciting angle for discussing satisficing play could be to discuss
the question whether satisficing play is a plausible model for MAL.
Maybe the performance of satisficing play too much depends on the
algorithm's parameters and the value of the initial aspirations.
Another approach is that it may be interesting to see which
game types are amenable to satisficing play, and argue why that
is the case.
