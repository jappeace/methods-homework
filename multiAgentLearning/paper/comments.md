Review form
===========

In short this review states that still,
as might be expected from the current state of the paper,
a lot of effort should
be put into writing this paper to make it sufficient.
Most important is the lack of structure and additional information
that illustrates the structure and the overall message of the paper.

The goal of this form is to help the author to improve his paper.
Both the review and the concept paper are graded as assignments.

Format discipline
-----------------
It does not follow the guidelines of a CS-magazine.
For instance, it misses callouts, intermezzi and/or quotes. It could
be improved by adding these, but more importantly try to rethink the
organization of the paper by for instance grouping
certain sections like the sections about the prisoner's dilemma and make
current sections (for instance properties of satisficing play) like callouts.

Composition
-----------
The structure of the paper is not very clear.
Which can for instance be noticed by the lack of an overview of the paper and
the uninformative headings.

This point could for instance be improved by adding a table of content 
and more informative headers, or at least mentioning
the structure of the paper in the introduction.

Composition (theme & thread)
----------------------------
The main thread is not clear. It seems to be an overview of
satisficing play; this is also improved by a clear introduction.
Furthermore, there is no thread recognizable, this could for instance be
improved by adding introductions to every section.
The message of the paper is also unclear and I even expect their is not
any (due to the title, which is just the name of the overall topic).

By adding an abstract, introduction and discussion/conclusion the whole
theme and thread together with the global message
becomes clearer. Though also the headings and introductions to the sections
could be more informative.

Clarity and comprehensibility
-----------------------------
The paper is clear, though with lots of 'gaps' and typos.
Improving the length of the paper should be sufficient to make the
paper clear.

Scientific level
----------------
I can only discuss the algorithm by
Karandikar et al. (1998) (since it is the only thing present),
which is (as far of I know)
incomplete and I would by no way call this part in-depth.
It lacks for instance an in-depth description of what it does and why
it does it.

Regarding the incompleteness, I do not see all the aspects,
like inertia, that are characteristic to Karandikar's algorithm.
So I question whether it is Karandikar et al.'s algorithm or simply the
'simplified' way as how it was described in Stimpson
et al. (2001). Also no experiments are present, though announced shortly.

Credibility
-----------
To find it is convincing I tried to look for argumentation/claims,
the only thing I found was the claim of the Nash equilibrium
which states that it tries to "solve" the prisoner's dilemma by "teaching".
I found this weird, since it satisficing play is no
teaching strategy and what meant "solving", which was not explained at all. 
So I have to conclude that writing is not cogent.
and sound.

Attractiveness
--------------
It does not include any figures, sub-headers or call outs. 
The only thing it contains are tables (see more about this in
References). Therefore, it is not attractive and I would not read it if 
I didn't have to. To improve this, add additional sub-
headers and call outs.

References
----------
This can be greatly improved. For instance,
there is no caption for the tables in the paper and the citations are all in the
format "... results by (Author, Year)" whereas the text often suggests
"results by Author (Year)" to make the text and citation
more natural. Although this is seen often, I am not sure whether
this is mandatory regarding referencing.

Furthermore, the paper references to A. Simon as the inventor of
satisficing play, though as far as I know his name
was Herbert A. Simon. The same goes for other authors like Jeff Stimpson,
to which is referred as "Stimpson L.". Also in the
bibliography the references to the page numbers are present,
though empty (denoted "[p]"). The literature that is probably meant
is referenced in the paper though.

The paper consists of just one table (in this I assume that the matrix of
the iterated prisoner's dilemma is an equation and
therefore not a table) on the other hand, though for clarity and to make it
able to reference to this table in the text it would
be nice to add a caption to this table to prevent referencing like
"... seen below:".

This can be fixed by looking closely at the LaTeX markup for citations and
captions.

Tidiness
--------
The layout, fonts, formatting and page numbering is correct.
Which is primarily due to the used template. Even though the paper
is very short, the amount of typos is not low. Some examples:
	- "bellow" -> below
	- "prisoners" -> prisoner's
	- "satisifing" -> satisficing
	- "wehreas" -> whereas
	- Sentences that do not start with a capital
	- No starting capital in some names like "stimpson"

Also language can be improved, like for instance removing "vs" and
replacing it by "versus" or "against", which makes the overall
style of the paper better.

Based on this I can only conclude that the tidiness of the paper is not up
to the standard you might expect in the final paper.
Though this can be addressed easily by looking critically at what is
written and how it was written.


VREESWIJK:

Globally: the paper seems to be heading in the right direction.
Satisficing play is discussed and just enough mathematical
detail is given. The small tables look nice and are convenient
references. However, right now I find the approach somewhat
conservative.  The paper's ambition seems to be to explain
satisficing play.  Of course a lucid explanation is important,
but you can be critical.
A more exciting angle for discussing satisficing play could be to discuss
the question whether satisficing play is a plausible model for MAL.
Maybe the performance of satisficing play too much depends on the
algorithm's parameters and the value of the initial aspirations.
Another approach is that it may be interesting to see which
game types are amenable to satisficing play, and argue why that
is the case.

Details: "The Nash equilibrium of this games" => "of this game".
In general, the direction in which the concept paper
is going looks promising.
I very much look forward to the final version.
