Question 1 isn't probably treated as much...
Figure out how to calculate expected utility.

0.5  0.5
2 1 | 0 0
0 0 | 1 2

multiply probability with respective utility.
note that always choosing the same is also a mixed
strategy namely choice 1, 0

Need to remember the proof for truth telling?
Just show its inefective to lie basically?
1. Agent bids lower then its true value and wins
2. ... loses
	1. The true value is higher than the winner.
	2. The agent is lower than the winner.
3. Higher and wins.
	1. Agent pays higher than true val
	2. agent pays lower.
4.
