You miss citations.

The introduction and conclusions seem really long compared to the rest
of the paper.
You start after the introduction with a solution but no problem has been
specified (or was that the introduction)?

I often don't get the meaning of allineas, what is the purpose of them?
Each one should have a contained goal be a statement if you will
and each should somehow advance the plot/thread you're working towards.
I guess it just misses structure...

What is the point of this paper?
