* The singularity

If there was some "intelligence" tenhnology,
of which more can be created,
which in turns creates more technology.

This causes an "intelligence explosion".

This does not have to be an AI. It can be some implant
or some kind of "syntetic life".

Humans do not qualify because
"if we have better sex... it does not follow that our babies will be geniuses"
(Chalmer 2010:18)

** COMMENT Do computers quilify?
Perhaps? because computers help us with designing better computers?
.. probably need a reference for that?


* Aliens
The singularity may be comparable to apes watching humans evolve.

If the consequences of Nanotechnology, BioTechnology IT and cognitive Science
are considered then generated life forms may be completely different from us, or
aliens. This is called speulative posthumanism

These aliens may be very good or erredicate
MOSH (Mostly original substrate human) or worse..
