#+TITLE: questions

Should I treat UML in the background section?
Because I use that for most diagrams.

Should I add more diagrams to BDI & Jung? I sortoff don't know about what more to make it?

I didn't add an overview in chapter 3 because it didn't fit in there because its
to detailed for that chapter.
I pushed it down to a new chapter instead, is this OK?
