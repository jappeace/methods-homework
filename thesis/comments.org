#+TITLE: questions

Should I treat UML in the background section?
Because I use that for most diagrams.

Should I add more diagrams to BDI & Jung? I sortoff don't know about what more to make it?

I didn't add an overview in chapter 3 because it didn't fit in there because its
to detailed for that chapter.
I pushed it down to a new chapter instead, is this OK?

Should I refer to a design practices book (I was thinking head first design patterns)? I mean I do most stuff by heart but
I'm pretty sure all the stuff I do is written somewhere..
 Could be in Qaulity attributes?
 Could be in head first design patterns?
