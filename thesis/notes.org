* Paper Info stat approach to dialogue management
** Shared private distinction.
Doesn't allow for misscomunication, for example one agent thinking the QUD is
about are apples green? wheras the other thinks its about are fire trucks fassed
(when just a topic change occured such confusion should be moddable).

However it would be possible to do this if the shared believes are just
believed  to be shared, ie each agents has their own believe base of which a
part is believed to be shared.
But then there is no reason to make a distinction.

... although they said its just an example.
