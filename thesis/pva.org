This document describes a thesis plan for Jappie Klooster.

* Research question
** Main question
  How does adding personality to agents in an communication train game effect
  gameplay?
** Sub questions
*** What is the best personality theory to base a software model on?
I added this question because the other paper I read skimmed this subject but
didn't really go deep into it.
I think its important to add a solid foundation to the chosen theory.

Also I want to look at:
    In Weide et al, (Personality based practical reasoning 2008) the agent reasons
    about the users personality.
*** What does this theory say about comminucation?
For example something like this http://www.socionics.com/rel/relcht.htm
*** How can this theory be implemented in the existing game?
**** How far is agentification progressed and what still needs to be done?
**** How to map dialogue on a goal based system?
I think they use scripts in the SALVE game to solve this, but the scripts seem
to low level to work for personality, I think the api should become more
abstract to allow the system to reason about it if it goes according to the
proccess the personality of the agent likes.
