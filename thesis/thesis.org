* Personality Theories
The field of psychology has been somewhat active in trying to model human
personality cite:pervin2008handbook. 
Several frameworks have been developed to figure out people's
personality and what this in turn would mean for their lives.
We are interested in two ways in existing personality theories:
1. Accuracy, if a personality thoery does not fit the reality at all it won't
   help anyone in the serious game.
2. Ease of implementation. If the personality theory is too hard (or impossible)
   to implement in the serious game than we can't use it.
Luckily the field of psychology is very interested in the first requirement. 
However the second requirement not so much. Therefore our first job will be
to list existing psychology personality frameworks, and filter out those
that are unfeasible to implement.


** The big five
The first framework we'll discuss is called the big five.
This framework was not really invented, but rather discovered trough
lexical analyses cite:tupes1961recurrent.
Although the labels used were different,
they conveyed the same idea as the big five model used now.
The methodology what they used was basically applying manual data mining on a
dictionary and then look at what worked for personality. 
The term big five first coined in 1981 by Goldberg cite:goldberg1981language.
The big five were not big because of their intrinsic greatness, but rather to
emphasize how broad these factors were.

In the begining of the 1990's there were many ways to measure personality that
didn't agree with each other.
For example at Berkley alone block used a 2 dimensional ego-resilience and
ego-controll method cite:block1980role,
whereas gough measured folk concepts such as self-controll, well-being and
tolerance cite:gough1987california.
Personality researchers hoped that they would be the one to discover a structure
that would then be adopted by other researchers cite:pervin2008handbookp114.

The goal of the big five was not to present a new structure that convinced
others to use it.
But rather to provide a taxonomy that all psychologist could agree upon.
Since the big five was so broad, this worked.
Therefore the researchers could keep on exploring there niche,
with their proffered structure,
but once they would present their work they could use the big five to
communicate clearly what their research meant without having to redefining the
words every time cite:pervin2008handbookp114..116.

The big five as in the OCEAN definition has the following units of measurement:
- Openness or originality, if you score high on this you enjoy learning new
  things just for the sake of learning. If you score low then you don't enjoy
  this
- Conciseness, how tidy you are, if you score high the dishes don't stack up
  in the sink.
- Extroversion, a high score indicates you enjoy leading the conversation and
  you'll speak up when you disagree with someone.
- Agreeableness or altruism, a low score would indicate that you don't want to
  share and generally don't trust people.
- Neuroticism or nervousness, a high score indicates that you like to brag and
  get upset when someone is angry at them.

The big five has been extensively tested and the result has been replicated
in multiple studies cite:pervin2008handbookp119.

Although these terms may provide a great taxonomy,
it does not say anything about implementation.
By this we mean that lets say you have a score of 0.8 for Neuroticism,
how does this influence my decision for selecting action $a$ or $b$?
Now you could say, use a mixed strategy where in you choose 80% of the time
the neurotic typical neurotic approach.
Then we need a valuation function $v: A \mapsto i$ where $A$ is an action and
$i \in \mathbb{N}$ to decide which of the two actions is more neurotic.
This still leaves open the question of how this decision interacts with
the other dimensions,
which is non trivial to answer.

** Personality types
Much of the issues we had with the big five
could be solved by a theoretical foundation of personality types.
To do this we'll look first at the proposed method by the grandfather of 
personality research, Carl Jung.
After which we'll look at a thoeretical evolution proposed by Myers and
Myers-Brigs, which also introduced a structered method of measuring types.
Then we'll discuss some critique's on this method.
*** Jung's theory of psychological types
Jung describes several concepts, firstly each person has two attitudes:
/Introversion/ and /extroversion/.
Extroversion means dealing with the outside world and therfore is called
objective (or observable).
Intoversion is the world inside a person, and therefore is subjective,
or private.
Jung argues this may be so private that the consiouness can't even access it.
These attitudes are mutually exclusive,
you can't do introversion and extroversion at the same time.
For example if you're day dreaming you're not doing extroversion.
A person who spends most of his time in the introversion attitude is called
an /introvert/. But he is not totally the one or the other.
Then it should also be noted that the unconsciousness according to Jung is
flipped in attitude.
cite:hall1973primer

Then there are four functions that can be combined with the attitudes.
The first two functions are called the /rational functions/
because they act as a method of making judgements.
/Thinking/ is a function that connects ideas with each other to arrive at
generalizations or conclusions. 
/Feeling/ evaluates ideas by determinging if its good or bad, pleasant
or unpleasant, beautifull or ugly.
The /irrational functions/ are called this becuase they require no reason.
/Sensation/ is sense perception created by the stimulation of the senses,
it can always be rooted to a sense,
such as "I see a balloon" or "I feel hungry".
/Intuition/ is like a sensetion but its not produced by a sense.
Therefore it has no origin in the same way as sensation has,
by which its explained as "just a hunch" or "I feel it in my bones".

To use these functions they have to be combined with attitudes.
Therefore a person will never be of a thinking type,
but rather either a thinking introvert or thinking extrovert.
We can now imagine what this means,
an extroverted thinker will for example make judgement about the real world,
and therefore be more like a scientist,
whereas an introverted thinker will make judgement about ideas in his mind,
and therfore will be an excelent philosopher.
(Not to say type has anything to do with intelligence)

*** MBTI
The meyer brigs type indicator is based upon Carl Jung's theory of personality
types.
The Meyer brigs type indicator asses people in a similiar way that the big five
method does.
However once the assesment is complete the scores are reduced to a type.

*** Kersey's MBTI
Before continuing we would like to say a word about an extremely popular
interpertation of MBTI which we will call Kersey's MBTI.
In this interpertation the sixteen types are also placed in general groups
of four but here the $ST$ and $SF$ distinction is replaced by $SJ$ and $SP$
cite:keirsey1998please.
It turns out however that Kersey invented this distinction because
"He thought it made sense to group them this way" cite:whyaretypesdistinct.
In doing this he rejected the work of Jung and also that of cognitive functions.
Which is problematic because the theory he presented then does not make any
thoeretical sense.
Therefore Kersey's MBTI will not be used in this thesis.

*** TODO content oriented vs process orientated (token vs type?)
** TODO The best framework
In here we'll discuss what is the best framework for our usecase.
** TODO Simplification
In here we'll discuss what simplifications could be applied to the best
framework (this is use full to discuss because it makes it easier to create
a prototype).
** TODO Communication in framework
Here we discuss research into communication based on this framework.
