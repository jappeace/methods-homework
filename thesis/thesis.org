* Personality Theories
The field of psychology has been somewhat active in trying to model human
personality cite:pervin2008handbook. 
Several frameworks have been developed to figure out people's
personality and what this in turn would mean for their lives.
We are interested in two ways in existing personality theories:
1. Accuracy, if a personality thoery does not fit the reality at all it won't
   help anyone in the serious game.
2. Ease of implementation. If the personality theory is too hard (or impossible)
   to implement in the serious game than we can't use it.
Luckily the field of psychology is very interested in the first requirement. 
However the second requirement not so much. Therefore our first job will be
to list existing psychology personality frameworks, and filter out those
that are unfeasible to implement.


** The big five
The first framework we'll discuss is called the big five.
This framework was not really invented, but rather discovered trough
lexical analyses cite:tupes1961recurrent.
Although the labels used were different,
they conveyed the same idea as the big five model used now.
The methodology what they used was basically applying manual data mining on a
dictionary and then look at what worked for personality. 
The term big five first coined in 1981 by Goldberg cite:goldberg1981language.
The big five were not big because of their intrinsic greatness, but rather to
emphasize how broad these factors were.

In the begining of the 1990's there were many ways to measure personality that
didn't agree with each other.
For example at Berkley alone block used a 2 dimensional ego-resilience and
ego-controll method cite:block1980role,
whereas gough measured folk concepts such as self-controll, well-being and
tolerance cite:gough1987california.
Personality researchers hoped that they would be the one to discover a structure
that would then be adopted by other researchers cite:pervin2008handbookp114.

The goal of the big five was not to present a new structure that convinced
others to use it.
But rather to provide a taxonomy that all psychologist could agree upon.
Since the big five was so broad, this worked.
Therefore the researchers could keep on exploring there niche,
with their proffered structure,
but once they would present their work they could use the big five to
communicate clearly what their research meant without having to redefining the
words every time cite:pervin2008handbookp114..116.

The big five as in the OCEAN definition has the following units of measurement:
- Openness or originality, if you score high on this you enjoy learning new
  things just for the sake of learning. If you score low then you don't enjoy
  this
- Conciseness, how tidy you are, if you score high the dishes don't stack up
  in the sink.
- Extroversion, a high score indicates you enjoy leading the conversation and
  you'll speak up when you disagree with someone.
- Agreeableness or altruism, a low score would indicate that you don't want to
  share and generally don't trust people.
- Neuroticism or nervousness, a high score indicates that you like to brag and
  get upset when someone is angry at them.

The big five has been extensively tested and the result has been replicated
in multiple studies cite:pervin2008handbookp119.
One can measure his big five score trough a test called the NEO-PI, or the
NEO-FFI. The FFI variant is shorter but less precise cite:costa1992revised.

Although these terms may provide a great taxonomy,
it does not say anything about implementation.
By this we mean that lets say you have a score of 0.8 for Neuroticism,
how does this influence my decision for selecting action $a$ or $b$?
Now you could say, use a mixed strategy where in you choose 80% of the time
the neurotic typical neurotic approach.
Then we need a valuation function $v: A \mapsto i$ where $A$ is an action and
$i \in \mathbb{N}$ to decide which of the two actions is more neurotic.
This still leaves open the question of how this decision interacts with
the other dimensions,
which is non trivial to answer.

** Personality types
Much of the issues we had with the big five
could be solved by a theoretical foundation of personality types.
To do this we'll look first at the proposed method by the grandfather of 
personality research, Carl Jung.
After which we'll look at a thoeretical evolution proposed by Myers and
Myers-Brigs, which also introduced a structered method of measuring types.
Then we'll discuss some critique's on this method.
*** Jung's theory of psychological types
Jung describes several concepts, firstly each person has two attitudes:
/Introversion/ and /extroversion/.
Extroversion means dealing with the outside world and therfore is called
objective (or observable).
Intoversion is the world inside a person, and therefore is subjective,
or private.
Jung argues this may be so private that the consiouness can't even access it.
These attitudes are mutually exclusive,
you can't do introversion and extroversion at the same time.
For example if you're day dreaming you're not doing extroversion.
A person who spends most of his time in the introversion attitude is called
an /introvert/. But he is not totally the one or the other.
Then it should also be noted that the unconsciousness according to Jung is
flipped in attitude. cite:hall1973primer97-98attitude

Then there are four functions that can be combined with the attitudes.
The first two functions are called the /rational functions/
because they act as a method of making judgements.
/Thinking/ is a function that connects ideas with each other to arrive at
generalizations or conclusions. 
/Feeling/ evaluates ideas by determinging if its good or bad, pleasant
or unpleasant, beautifull or ugly.
Note that this is /not/ the same as being emotional,
although you can be emotional and use this function.
The /irrational functions/ are called this becuase they require no reason.
/Sensation/ is sense perception created by the stimulation of the senses,
it can always be rooted to a sense,
such as "I see a balloon" or "I feel hungry".
/Intuition/ is like a sensetion but its not produced by a sense.
Therefore it has no origin in the same way as sensation has,
by which its explained as "just a hunch" or "I feel it in my bones".
cite:hall1973primer98-100functions

To use these functions they have to be combined with attitudes.
Therefore a person will never be of a thinking type,
but rather either a thinking introvert or thinking extrovert.
cite:hall1973primer100-101combo
We can now imagine what this means,
an extroverted thinker will for example make judgement about the real world,
and therefore be more like a scientist,
whereas an introverted thinker will make judgement about ideas in his mind,
and therfore will be an excelent philosopher.

*** MBTI
The meyer brigs type indicator is based upon Carl Jung's theory of personality
types.
However it brings two important changes, first of all the way
of measuring personality type is changed. 
First of all it uses a strutured approach rather than Carl Jungs projective
approach.
The responses to items are finite and therefore can be deduced based on theory.
Jung used open ended anwsering with word associations for example cite:hall1973primer23method.
Then there is the introduction of the fourth letter to the type
cite:carlson1985recent.
Which is either a $J$ for judging or a $P$ for perceiving. this letter
indicates if the judging $J$ (rational) function is more preffered or the
perceiving $P$ (irrational) is.
However once the assesment is complete the scores are reduced to a type.

Before continuing we would like to say a word about an extremely popular
interpertation of MBTI which is based on Kersey's book "Please understand me",
and later "Please understand me II".
In this interpertation the sixteen types are also placed in general groups
of four but here the $ST$ and $SF$ distinction is replaced by $SJ$ and $SP$
cite:keirsey1998please.
It turns out however that Kersey invented this distinction because
"He thought it made sense to group them this way" cite:whyaretypesdistinct.
In doing this he rejected the work of Jung and also that of cognitive functions.
Which is problematic because the theory he presented then does not make any
thoeretical sense.
Therefore Kersey's MBTI will not be used in this thesis.

The MBTI is extremly popular in a subfield called Organizational Developement
(OD) cite:sample2004myers. 
But it has gotton some heavy critism in from the field of psycology.

MBTI expects if someone that is of type $I$ falls clearly into
the $I$ category,
therfore a bimodal distribution is expected.
This means that most people should eiter clearly fall into $I$ or $E$. 
however it has been shown that is not the case cite:bess2002bimodal,
but this could be the result of the scores being biderictional
cite:salter2005two.
An extended investigation into weather jungian constructs are truly categorial
however concluded that this was not the case and a continues scale is required
cite:arnau2003jungian.

It also fell short on factor analyses and reliability.
Factor analyses tries to deduce based on observerd variables potential
simpler un-observerd variables.
With this technique the desired outcome is that there are 4 question clusters
(or factors), one for each dimension.
Secondly these factors should be independent,
a question that influences I/E score should not influence S/N.
Finally we expect the factors to indicate differences between individuals.
Random questions won't do that.
However it turned out the MBTI had more than 4 factors (6), then there were
questions that were in different factors than the majority
and finally there were also some quetions doing no discrimination at all
(not being scored). cite:sipps1985item

Reliability indicates how often the same result will come out of the test,
for example if you take the mbti a 100 times you may be classified the same
type for 70 times.
Which would be an indication it has a reliablity of arround 70%.
But in psycology another aspect is important,
namely the interval in between which the tests are taken,
if for example two tests produce starkly different results but a lot of time
has passed between them its not considered a big issue.
However for the MBTI it has been shown that after a period of 5 weeks 50%
of the participants changed in score cite:pittenger1993measuring.



*** Alternatives to MBTI
There exist other implementation of Jung's type thoery that handle the
critisms a lot better, such as the PPSDQ and SL-TDI.
The SL-TDI stays really close to jungian theory by keeping introversion 
and extroversion as attitudes rather than traits.
It also has a strong cooralation with the big-five. 
Although the PPSDQ is internally more consistent cite:arnau1999alternative.

The PPSDQ keeps basically the same theory as MBTI but uses a different measuring
method. Instead of forced questions it uses a word-pair checklist for
$I/E, S/N$ and $T/F$, and for the $J/P$ self describing sentences are used
cite:melancon1996measurement.
A word pair checklist looks like:

| Word          |   |   |   | Word      |
|---------------+---+---+---+-----------|
| Empathy       | 1 | 2 | 3 | Logic     |
| Dispassionate | 1 | 2 | 3 | Emotional |
The sentence is a statement in which you can agree or disagree. 
This test method is simple but effective.

SLTDI measures functions by presenting 20 situations and then giving subject
possible actions which corrolate with the functions.
The subjects then have to indicate how likely it is that they would choose that
particular action cite:arnau2000reliability.

Both of these alternatives use a continues scale and have a high cooralation with
the big five cite:arnau1997measurement.
The PPSDQ is measuring the same thing as MBTI cite:kier1997new,king1999score,
but does not suffer from the same critisms as MBTI.
**** TODO more extended treatment of all critisisms that don't apply
     For example I read somewhere they're more reliable but I need to find the
     source first, and factor analyses has been done in earlier cited papers
     but this needs to be referenced too.
